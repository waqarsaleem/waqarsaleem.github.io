Below is important information regarding the contest. As much as possible, the contest will follow the [ICPC](https://icpc.global/) format. The platform on which the contest will be held is [CodeForces](https://codeforces.com/).

## Format

All teams will be assigned the same problem set through CodeForces. You will also be given a hard copy of the problem set. You will write programs to solve the problems and submit your solutions through CodeForces for automatic testing against prepared test cases which are not visible to you. Your score in the contest depends on the number of correct solutions that you submit and how quickly you submit them. More details on scoring are given below.

## Logistics

The contest takes place on Saturday, 9 April, in Linux Lab, from 11-13h. Your team should reach the lab by 1045h so that you are settled in by 11h when the contest begins.

## Participation

Participation is in teams of 3. Each team will use a single computer with _no Internet access_ except to CodeForces. Rough paper will be provided but you must have your own writing implements. You will have to submit your devices during participation.

## Scoring

A scoreboard with live scores of all the participating teams will be projected on the screen. Scores are computed as follows.

- Teams are grouped in the scoreboard by the number of problems that they have correctly solved.
- Groups with more correct solutions are ranked higher.
- Within a group, the team with the lesser score is ranked higher.
- A team's score in any problem is the sum of:
  - the number of minutes between the start of the contest and the submission of a correct solution
  - the penalties for each incorrect submission for the problem.

## Prizes and Review
There is a prize for each of the top 3 ranked positions.

Additionally, there are special participation prizes.
