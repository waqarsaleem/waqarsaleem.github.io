## Format

All teams will be assigned the same problem set through CodeForces. You will also be given a hard copy of the problem set. You will write programs to solve the problems and submit your solutions through CodeForces for automatic testing against prepared test cases which are not visible to you. Your score in the contest depends on the number of correct solutions that you submit and how quickly you submit them. More details on scoring are given below.

## Logistics

The contest takes place on Wednesday, 28 September, in Math Lab, from 845-1130h. Your team should reach the lab by 830h so that you are settled in when the contest begins.

## Participation

Participation is in teams of 3. Each team will use a single computer with _no Internet access_ except to CodeForces. Rough paper will be provided but you must have your own writing implements. You will have to submit your devices prior to the start of the competition.

## Scoring

A scoreboard with live scores of all the participating teams will be projected on the screen. Scores are computed as follows.

- Teams are grouped in the scoreboard by the number of problems that they have correctly solved.
- Groups with more correct solutions are ranked higher.
- Within a group, the team with the lesser score is ranked higher.
- A team's score in any problem is the sum of:
  - the number of minutes between the start of the contest and the submission of a correct solution
  - the penalties for each incorrect submission for the problem.

- the team with the overall first rank
