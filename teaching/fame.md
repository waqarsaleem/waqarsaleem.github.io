# Hall of Fame

<font size = "2">[WS](https://waqarsaleem.github.io/) > [Teaching](./) > Hall of Fame</font>

Course evaluations are a lot of fun. Every once in a while, a student formulates their frustrations so cleverly that I cannot help but chuckle. Here is my Hall of Fame of interesting comments from student evaluations. I am putting them here verbatim. In some cases, I will put the relevant fragment instead of the entire comment.

- He is quite robotic which shows how much he loves programming. (CS 101 Programming Fundamentals, Fall 2022)
- You have to be a robot or non human to be a student of waqar saleem, or else you are gone. (CS 113 Discrete Mathematics, Spring 2022)
- Waqar is a nice man, but he is a terrible professor. (CSCI 155 Computer Graphics, Spring 2019).
- One of the highlights from the tips he gave us was , â€˜there is no shame in sipping some water in case your mouth gets dry. (CS 100 Computer Science Freshman Seminar, Fall 2018)
- It is like they taught us how to do 2+2=4 in classes but asked us to solve 3rd order differential equations in the assignment. (CS 113 Discrete Mathematics, Spring 2018)
- We are paying him to teach us he is not doing it for free so he needs to understand that we can question about things which we don't understand. (CS 111 Computational Thinking II, Summer 2016)
- it is my favorite subject but I still feel sleepy in the class. (CS 130 Digital Logic and Design, Spring 2016)
- I want tim. He teaches well. Waqar is all about jokes and all. (CS 130 Digital Logic and Design, Spring 2016)
- You're cool, Dr. Waqar. (CS 110 Computational Thinking I, Spring 2016)
- This course was pathetic! No help provided at first, we have risked our futures, horrible. (CS 111 Computational Thinking II, Fall 2015)
- Dr. Waqar was very helpful sometimes. (CS 110 Computational Thinking I, Fall 2015)
