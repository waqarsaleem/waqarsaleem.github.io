[Kaavish](https://www.rekhta.org/urdudictionary?keyword=kaavish) is the CS capstone project. It spans the entirety of the senior year.

<!---


This is a second-semester course for CS students at Habib University and very quickly got cross-listed with MATH. Like similar courses in most CS programs, this course introduces students to logic, proofs, and other foundational mathematical material like sets, functions, and graphs. The intention is two-fold. One, students are prepared for rigorous logical arguments such as those needed in later courses to prove computability and correctness of algorithms. Two, students become familiar with the mathematical constructs that underlie much of theoretical computer science.

Students attempt and submit assignments in teams. The release and submission of assignments is through [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/) and submissions are typeset in [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org).

I have been involved in the design and offering of this course since its inception in Spring 2018. (I missed the Spring 2019 offering due to my [exchange semester at Pitzer College](https://habib.edu.pk/HU-news/building-global-partnerships-dr-waqar-saleems-faculty-exchange-experience-at-pitzer-college/).) It has since been offered every Spring. We follow the textbook by [Rosen](https://www.amazon.com/Discrete-Mathematics-Applications-Kenneth-Rosen/dp/125967651X). Over the offerings, some topics have gone in and out of the syllabus, e.g. cryptography and relations. Some offerings have included a student project. I was the course lead for all the offerings listed below.

## Spring 2023

[LMS](https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/XXX) | [Syllabus](./syllabi/Syllabus - CS 113 - Spring 2023.pdf) | Evaluation _(course ongoing)_ | [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/121288367-cs-math-113-discrete-mathematics-spring-2023)

Having recently taught for the first time the follow-on courses [CS 212 Nature of Computation](./cs212) and [CS 412 Nature of Computation ](./cs412) which were originally developed and taught by my ex-colleagues [Jibran Rashid](https://www.iba.edu.pk/faculty-profile.php?id=jrashid) and [Shahid Hussain](https://www.iba.edu.pk/faculty-profile.php?ftype=&id=shahidhussain), I have realized the inadequacies of this course.

Previous offerings spent a lot of class time on definitions, examples, and non-examples. This offering moves those to recitations. Lectures will focus on proofs and argumentation. There will be many short assessments for quick feedback: quizzes, weekly challenge, shorter homework. In-person midterm and final exams are back. The project is back and teams will present selected proofs from [Proofs from THE BOOK](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-662-57265-8). Team work is eschewed at least at the start so that students are individually challenged.

## Spring 2022

[LMS](https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/1898) | [Syllabus](./syllabi/Syllabus - CS 113 - Spring 2022.pdf) | [Evaluation](./evals/Eval - CS 113 - Spring 2022.pdf) | [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/97152462-cs-113-discrete-mathematics-spring-2022)

We returned to campus midway through the semester and held an in-person mid-term exam which we had suspended in the online offerings. The result indicated a severe need of providing rigorous exercise to the students. I held a 10-minute in-class qiuzz at the start of every class in the later half of the semester. I was also supported by a very dedicated team of TAs headed by [Khubaib Kasbati](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khubaib-kasbati/?originalSubdomain=pk) who prepared rigorous recitations and engaged closely with the faculty. As some measures were introduced ad-hoc in the later half of the semester, many students were unappreciative but I feel these were required to help the students achieve the learning outcomes.

## Spring 2021

[LMS](https://hulms.instructure.com/courses/1262) | [Syllabus](./syllabi/Syllabus - CS 113 - Spring 2021.pdf) | [Evaluation](./evals/Eval - CS 113 - Spring 2021.pdf) | [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/77562667-cs-113-discrete-mathematics-spring-2021)

Another mathematician, [Rameez Ragheb](https://habib.edu.pk/SSE/rameez-ragheb/), was involved. The course was completely remote so exams were out of the question. We introduced a group project in which student teams selected and presented on a [project topic](./files/CS 113 - Spring 2021 - Project Topics.pdf). We also replaced in-person quizzes with short, online quizzes which served more as revision tools than assessments. Unlimited attempts were allowed within the allowed duration of about a fortnight. 

## Spring 2020

[LMS](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/portal/site/3bdced2c-d399-4a25-bbb8-05ceef08fa42) (now defunct) | [Syllabus](./syllabi/Syllabus - CS 113 - Spring 2020.pdf) | Evaluation: [L1](./evals/Eval - CS 113 L1 - Spring 2020.pdf) [L4](./evals/Eval - CS 113 L4 - Spring 2020.pdf) | [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/49143948-cs-113-discrete-mathematics-spring-2020)

The list of topics to be covered was curtailed so as to focus on the more important topics instead of hurriedly covering a larger number. I taught two sections along with a full-on mathematician, [Carina Dreyer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/carina-dreyer-bb5510194/). We also had a very able assistant, [Basem Atiq](https://www.linkedin.com/in/basem-atiq-382b6b106/?originalSubdomain=de). We were able to make good slides containing many examples and non-examples. We also introduced a weekly recitation session for students to gain hands-on practice.

We had to transition online in the middle of this semester. 

## Spring 2018

[LMS](https://lms.habib.edu.pk/portal/site/99da1b59-6b84-4954-8a67-8abcade30512/page/17f66821-21d7-48f7-b7fc-bf2424dbbf26) (now defunct) | [Syllabus](./syllabi/Syllabus - CS 113 - Spring 2018.pdf) | [Evaluation](./evals/Eval - CS 113 - Spring 2018.pdf) | [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/34622007-cs-113-discrete-mathematics-spring-2018)

This was the first and most ambitious offering. Many topics were originally included in the syllabus, which turned out to be unrealistic.
