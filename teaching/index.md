This page covers my teaching at [Habib University](https://habib.edu.pk) with which I have been affiliated since 2012 and where I founded the [Computer Science](https://habib.edu.pk/academics/sse/computer-science/) program. Classes began at Habib University in Fall 2014.

I have taught diverse courses, listed below, but some constants in my courses are minimal use of paper, the use of technology, and teamwork. Except for short, in-class quizzes and in-person exams, none of my coursework involves paper submissions. This is made possible by the use of LMS and, more usefully, [GitHub Classroom](https://classroom.github.com). Assignment submissions are usually code and/or LaTeX files.

Students today have immense access to information. I am but one source. Rather than a purveyor of information, I try to be a deliverer of outcomes. One important outcome is for students to see each other as collaborators, and to build the confidence to convey, share, and receive information among each other. Working with others is an important life skill required in whichever pursuit the students choose after their undergraduate. I enforce teamwork in my courses and over time have developed a [_buddy system_](./buddy) around it.

I am a first-principles person. My approach is articulated nicely in the following comment from a student evaluation of one of my courses.

>"One must appreciate his philosophy of a bottom-up approach to learning. to elaborate, the instructor chooses to focus upon the foundational aspects of a subject and eschews an implementation-based approach, holding that a complete comprehension and mastery of these aspects effectively brings one to plane where the sky is the limit – what follows next simply builds upon and uses what came before thus, one can simply self-learn and progress further. additionally, a complete understanding of a notion helps in implementation itself – given that implementation is simply a form of articulating what one wishes to convey or achieve."
