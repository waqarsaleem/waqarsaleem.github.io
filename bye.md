TLDR: I have officially submitted my resignation effective 1 August, 2025. Let us party together until 1 June, after which it is Sayonara from me!

Long version: In order to not clutter this chat, and to have the liberty to self-aggrandize and pretend like my thoughts and experiences matter to anyone, I have put the long version at XXX.

--------------------------------------------------

I returned from my graduate studies an underachieving (to put it kindly), disillusioned, and underconfident researcher. My lure to higher studies had been a natural continuation of academics, which my scores and teachers told me I am good at, and the opportunity to explore CS, which I loved. But my graduate experience turned out to be a very different beast. Habib gave me the opportunity to create the educational experience that I wish I had had.

It has always been somewhat amusing to find myself in leadership roles. So I tried hard not to let down the people who had entrusted me so, and used it as an opportunity to realize my personal goals. Some principles that I surprisingly found in myself and which served me well were: leading by example, trust ("Hire the best people, and then get out of their way"), being hands-on, giving respect where it is due, taking challenges head-on ("take the bull by the horns"), using difficult challenges as an opportunity for growth, applying a first-principles approach, accountability and transparency, treating others how I would like to be treated, being to the point, respecting others' time, taking ownership of my actions, and allowing people the room to make mistakes (not to be confused with being incompetent).

I believe that actions speak louder than words (I remember from when I followed cricket, a commentator saying of Tendulkar that he is a quiet guy who lets his bat do the talking). Various life experiences have led me to abhor gossip and view with suspicion, those who relish it. I was keenly aware of the privilege that comes with positions of authority, and sought to subvert the common misuse of it by being especially fair and inclusive. Lastly, I cannot overstate how much my CS background shaped and helped my sense of organization and systems.

I often found myself having to decide between the people and the organization. I chose to believe that the organization is an amalgam of the people it contains and I always erred in favor of the people.

What I found absolutely invaluable throughout was having an able, intelligent assistant. By far, my most pleasurable and rewarding experiences in these roles were my weekly meetings, frequent visits to Cafe 2 Go, and numerous off-hand conversations with Fateeha and with Aala when they coordinated for my offices. Not only did I get a sympathetic ear for my rants, I enjoyed the privilege of smart and pleasing company, and a reality check on my performance. It is no exaggeration that I would have achieved only a meager fraction of what I did in those roles, were it not for these coordinators.

Having seen the strengths and weaknesses of various people in leadership roles, I realize that some areas where I failed miserably are having difficult conversations and cultivating leadership. There are others who do it well and I continue to be inspired by them.

Nonetheless, leading the CS program has been one of the most meaningful experiences of my life.

My goal was to set up a CS program which would house people like me - people who are academics because of teaching, invested in their students, and excited about pedagogy. The program would house charismatic instructors who would not only inspire students the way I was inspired by mine, but also each other, continually motivating us to be the best versions of ourselves. Its students would espouse a love of the discipline. They would find fun in geeky activities like hacking the system network and watching live streams of Starcraft matches! Our classrooms would have lively discussions on the content and benefit from equal representation of our young male and female population. Graduates would be noted not only for their technical excellence but for being ethical, conscientious, learned, and generally fun and interesting human beings.

However, despite the length of this note, I am not one to burden others with my wishes or ideals, let alone enforce them. Someone once said to be the change you want to see. I worked diligently toward my ideals. If, in the process, others caught on, all the better.

The decision to leave stems from a combination of push and pull factors pertaining to a variety of factors relating to the country--its economy, politics, governance, and society; my family conditions; and workplace situation. People are complex---the same factor can sometimes be a push factor and sometimes, pull; different factors take on different weights at different times; some factors may diminish from my active recollection, only to resurface later; and so on. The decision is therefore not necessarily binary, rather stems from a constant ebb and flow, and i just happened to take sustained action during a particular state of mind.

Is this the right decision? I do not know. Maybe. I am not fond of absolute qualifiers like right, wrong, good, and bad. The question is not, what is the meaning of life, someone said, rather, what meaning will I give to my life. I will work to make this the right decision. Will I have regrets? Probably, at times. And at times, I will celebrate it.

Will I miss Habib? Surely. I spent many good years here, interacted with bright young minds, and learned from inspiring colleagues. Habib developed my sensitivity to ideas that were nowhere on my radar. It trusted me in roles that I never thought myself capable of. It allowed me the freedom to experiment and contributed to my growth in many ways. It showered me with respect and reverence at a scale that continues to humble me. Were there bad experiences? Sure, it would be strange if there weren't. Are there particular factors that delayed or hastened this decision? Verily, but that is a complex mix and, by now, a moot point. Oh, and I absolutely love the swimming pool! I would like these thoughts to not be a deadweight heartache, rather, a guiding light that I continually carry with me and which informs me in my future pursuits.

What about the CS program? Well, I am as curious as you! As I said, the whole is an amalgam of the people that constitute it. There will be new people, new directions, new initiatives, and the program will take new shape, which I very much look forward to observe. And frankly, I increasingly see myself as an impediment to this necessary evolution. As time passes, I find myself growing rigid, skeptical of change, and nostalgic for "the good old days". This, if anything, is a sign that I need a change.

Overall, I like to think of myself as a wandering spirit. Looking back, I spent, roughly, 8 years in Tunisia/Libya, 1 in England, 8 in Pakistan, 4 in Canada, 4 in Pakistan, 9 in Germany, and 13 in Pakistan. My stint at Habib has been my longest anywhere. I would venture that I spent my "prime" at Habib. Staying too long in one place makes me restless, and I believe I still have some juice left in me before I start to get comfortable. As we proselytize to our students, outside the comfort zone is where learning happens. Or as Steve Jobs put it, "stay hungry, stay foolish". And the internet has long taught us, "I will rest when I am dead".

I look forward to the next phase in my life with enthusiasm, excitement, and positive nervousness. Things that do weigh me down are thoughts of my old parents whom I cannot currently take with me, any potential adverse effects to my children, and thoughts of students on campus who ask me if I am offering Computer Graphics next semester. But ultimately, I submit to Ekko's wisdom, "Sometimes taking a leap forward means leaving a few things behind".
